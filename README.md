## ðŸ”„ Workflow

The QA process follows this workflow:

1. **Brief Upload**: Upload campaign brief through the Streamlit interface or specify path in environment variables
2. **Brief Validation**: The `brief.py` module validates the brief for errors and inconsistencies
3. **Data Extraction**: The `beeswax_api.py` module connects to Beeswax API and fetches campaign data
4. **QA Processing**: The `run_qa.py` orchestrates specialized validation modules:
   - `qa_flight_v3.py`: Validates flight dates between brief and API data
   - `name_assign.py`: Verifies naming conventions for campaigns, line items, and creatives
   - `targeting.py`: Validates targeting settings like geo, operating systems, and content categories
   - `creative.py`: Checks creative settings against specifications
5. **Report Generation**: All results are compiled into a comprehensive Excel report with multiple tabs

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:7777` in your browser
3. Upload a campaign brief file (Excel or CSV format)
4. Review brief validation results
5. Click "Generate QA Report" to initiate the full QA process
6. Download the resulting QA report

### Running from Command Line

For automated workflows, you can also run the QA process from the command line:

```bash
python run_qa.py --brief path/to/brief.xlsx --output path/to/output
```

## ðŸ”’ Security

- Credentials are managed through environment variables and never committed to the repository
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude sensitive files such as `.env` files
- Streamlit secrets can be used for secure credential management in deployed environments
